# Thread Router Setup

The signed sensor data tutorial requires a Thread router to be present, which
multicasts both signed and unsigned data to participant boards. We provide a
pre-built flash image that performs this task here:
[signed-sensor-data-router.hex](../../assets/signed-sensor-data-tutorial/signed-sensor-data-router.hex).

## Flashing the Binary

You can flash this binary with an arbitrary tool that can program `hex` files,
such as `JLinkExe` or `probe-rs`. It may be that you need to reset the board
after flashing, for example by pressing the physical `RESET` button.

```
$ probe-rs
probe-rs download --chip nRF52840_xxAA --format hex signed-sensor-data-router.hex

## Interacting with the Router

Once you have flashed this image, it should provide you with an OpenThread CLI
on the serial console. You can use this to inspect the state of the device, such
as through `tockloader listen`:

```
$ tockloader listen
[INFO   ] Using "/dev/ttyACM0 - J-Link - CDC".
[INFO   ] Listening for serial output.

> state
leader
Done
```

You can get a list of attached devices through `child table`:

```
> child table
