# Hands-on Guides

This portion of the book includes workshops and tutorials to teach how to use
and develop with Tock, and is divided into two sections: the course and a series
of mini tutorials. The course is a good place to start, and provides a
structured introduction to Tock that should take a few hours to complete (it was
designed for a half day workshop). The tutorials are smaller examples that
highlight specific features.

## Tock Course

In this hands-on guide, we will look at some of the high-level services provided
by Tock.  We will start with an understanding of the OS and its programming
environment.  Then we'll look at how a process management application can help
afford remote debugging, diagnosing and fixing a resource-intensive app over the
network.  The last part of the tutorial is a bit more free-form, inviting
attendees to further explore the networking and application features of Tock or
to dig into the kernel a bit and explore how to enhance and extend the kernel.

This course assumes some experience programming embedded devices and fluency in
C. It assumes no knowledge of Rust, although knowing Rust will allow you to be
more creative during the kernel exploration at the end.

## Tock Mini Tutorials

These [tutorials](./tutorials/tutorials.html) feature specific examples of Tock
applications. They can be completed after the course to learn about different
capabilities of Tock apps.
