# Deprecated Course Modules

These modules were previously developed but may not quite match the current Tock
code at this point. That is, the general ideas are still relevant and correct,
but the specific code might be somewhat outdated.

We keep these for interested readers, but want to note that it might take a bit
more problem solving/updating to follow these steps than originally intended.
